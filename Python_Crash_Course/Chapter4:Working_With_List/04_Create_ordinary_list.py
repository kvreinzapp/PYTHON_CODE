# You can use either of these two approaches when youâ€™re making more
# complex lists. Sometimes using a temporary variable makes your code eas-
# ier to read
# other times it makes the code unnecessarily long. Focus first on
# writing code that you understand clearly, which does what you want it to do.
# Then look for more efficient approaches as you review your code.

# If an index error occurs and you canâ€™t figure out how to resolve it, try printing your
# list or just printing the length of your list. Your list might look much different than
# you thought it did, especially if it has been managed dynamically by your program.
# Seeing the actual list, or the exact number of items in your list, can help you sort out
# such logical errors.
